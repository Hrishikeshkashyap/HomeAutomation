# HomeAutomation

### Wanted to build a webapp controlled home automation system to control my room electronics

The components used :
NodeMCU (ESP8266-12E)
2-Channel 
Relay 
ModuleBreadboardJumper Wire

Connection:

Once the arduino code is flashed into the NodeMCU its esp8266 module will generate an access point. Once connected and opened the address 192.168.43.123 on your browser the controller webpage will pop up which acts as the remote.
